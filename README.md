### hi, i'm tetra ðŸ‘‹
i don't write programs as much as i used to anymore, but i still use github for archival purposes or maybe the one-off projects i create

nowadays i make music, **you can take a look on these platforms:**
* [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/tetrafox)
* [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3BCEPJ0GHgaZzCD5cSTEjv)
* [apple music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tetra/1470017364)

<sup>weird, using github to promote music, whatever</sup>
